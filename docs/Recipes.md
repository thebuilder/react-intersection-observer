# Recipes

The IntersectionObserver itself is just a simple but powerful tool. Here's a few
ideas for how you can use it.

## Lazy image load

It's actually easy to create your own lazy image loader, and this allows you to
build it according to your needs.

**Couple of tips**

- Don't set the `src` (or `srcset`) on the image until it's visible. Images will
  always load their `src`, even if you set `display: none;`.
- Make sure to set the
  [root margin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/rootMargin)
  for top and bottom, so the Intersection Observer gets triggered before the
  image enters the viewport. This gives the image a chance to be loaded before
  the user even sees it. Try and start with something like `200px 0px`, but
  experiment with it until you find the right value.
- Set `triggerOnce`, so you don't keep monitoring for changes.
- You should always create a wrapping element, that sets the correct aspect
  ratio for the image. You can set the padding bottom to be
  `${height / width * 100}%` to maintain aspect ratio.
- Either hide the `<img />` with CSS, or skip rendering it until it's inside the
  viewport.

```jsx
import React, { useRef } from 'react'
import { useInView } from 'react-intersection-observer'

const LazyImage = ({ width, height, src, ...rest }) => {
  const ref = useRef(null)
  const inView = useInView(ref, {
    triggerOnce: true,
    threshold: 1,
  })

  return (
    <div
      ref={ref}
      style={{
        position: 'relative',
        paddingBottom: `${(height / width) * 100}%`,
        background: '#2a4b7a',
      }}
    >
      {inView ? (
        <img
          {...rest}
          src={src}
          style={{ position: 'absolute', width: '100%', height: '100%' }}
        />
      ) : null}
    </div>
  )
}

export default LazyImage
```

## Trigger animations

Triggering animations once they enter the viewport is also a perfect use case
for an IntersectionObserver.

- Set `triggerOnce`, to only trigger the animation the first time.
- Use `threshold` to control when the animations triggers.

```jsx
import React, { useRef } from 'react'
import { useInView } from 'react-intersection-observer'
import { useSpring, animated } from 'react-spring'

const LazyAnimation = () => {
  const ref = useRef()
  const inView = useInView(ref, {
    threshold: 0.5,
  })
  const props = useSpring({ opacity: inView ? 1 : 0 })

  return (
    <animated.div ref={ref} style={props}>
      <span aria-label="Wave">ðŸ‘‹</span>
    <animated./div>
  )
}

export default LazyAnimation
```
