# Recipes

The `IntersectionObserver` itself is just a simple but powerful tool. Here's a
few ideas for how you can use it.

## Lazy image load

It's actually easy to create your own lazy image loader, and this allows you to
build it according to your needs.

**Couple of tips**

- Don't set the `src` (or `srcset`) on the image until it's visible. Images will
  always load their `src`, even if you set `display: none;`.
- Make sure to set the
  [root margin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/rootMargin)
  for top and bottom, so the Intersection Observer gets triggered before the
  image enters the viewport. This gives the image a chance to be loaded before
  the user even sees it. Try and start with something like `200px 0px`, but
  experiment with it until you find the right value.
- Set `triggerOnce`, so you don't keep monitoring for changes.
- You should always create a wrapping element, that sets the correct aspect
  ratio for the image. You can set the padding bottom to be
  `${height / width * 100}%` to maintain aspect ratio.
- Either hide the `<img />` with CSS, or skip rendering it until it's inside the
  viewport.

> `loading` attribute on images. If it's supported, we can skip the `useInView`
> hook and render the `<img>`.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import useNativeLazyLoading from '@charlietango/use-native-lazy-loading'
import { useInView } from 'react-intersection-observer'

const LazyImage = ({ width, height, src, ...rest }) => {
  const supportsLazyLoading = useNativeLazyLoading()
  const [ref, inView] = useInView({
    triggerOnce: true,
    margin: '200px 0px',
  })

  return (
    <div
      ref={supportsLazyLoading === false ? ref : undefined}
      style={{
        position: 'relative',
        paddingBottom: `${(height / width) * 100}%`,
        background: '#2a4b7a',
      }}
    >
      {inView || supportsLazyLoading ? (
        <img
          {...rest}
          src={src}
          width={width}
          height={height}
          loading="lazy"
          style={{ position: 'absolute', width: '100%', height: '100%' }}
        />
      ) : null}
    </div>
  )
}

export default LazyImage
```

## Trigger animations

Triggering animations once they enter the viewport is also a perfect use case
for an IntersectionObserver.

- Set `triggerOnce`, to only trigger the animation the first time.
- Set `threshold`, to control how much of the element should visible before
  firing the event.
- Instead of `threshold`, you can use `rootMargin` to have a fixed amount be
  visible before triggering. Use a negative margin value, like `-100px 0`, to
  have it go inwards. You can also use a percentage value, instead of pixels.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { useInView } from 'react-intersection-observer'
import { useSpring, animated } from 'react-spring'

const LazyAnimation = () => {
  const [ref, inView] = useInView({
    rootMargin: '-100px 0',
  })
  const props = useSpring({ opacity: inView ? 1 : 0 })

  return (
    <animated.div ref={ref} style={props}>
      <span aria-label="Wave">ðŸ‘‹</span>
    </animated.div>
  )
}

export default LazyAnimation
```

## Track impressions

You can use `IntersectionObserver` to track when a user views your element, and
fire an event on your tracking service.

- Set `triggerOnce`, to only trigger an event the first time the element enters
  the viewport.
- Set `threshold`, to control how much of the element should visible before
  firing the event.
- Instead of `threshold`, you can use `rootMargin` to have a fixed amount be
  visible before triggering. Use a negative margin value, like `-100px 0`, to
  have it go inwards. You can also use a percentage value, instead of pixels.

```jsx
import React, { useEffect } from 'react'
import { useInView } from 'react-intersection-observer'

const TrackImpression = () => {
  const [ref, inView] = useInView({ triggerOnce: true, rootMargin: '-100px 0' })
  useEffect(() => {
    if (inView) {
      // Fire a tracking event to your tracking service of choice.
      dataLayer.push('Section shown') // Here's a GTM dataLayer push
    }
  }, [inView])

  return (
    <div ref={ref}>
      Exemplars sunt zeluss de bassus fuga. Credere velox ducunt ad audax amor.
    </div>
  )
}

export default TrackImpression
```
