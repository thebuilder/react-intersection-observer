# Introduction

`react-intersection-observer` enables you to monitor when elements in your
application enters or leaves the viewport. No complex configuration needed, just
wrap your views and it handles the events.

> The
> [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API)
> provides a way to asynchronously observe changes in the intersection of a
> target element with an ancestor element or with a top-level document's
> viewport.


## Installation

Install using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):

```
yarn add react-intersection-observer
```

or NPM:

```
npm install react-intersection-observer --save
```

> ⚠️ You also want to add the
> [intersection-observer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-intersection-observer)
> polyfill for full browser support. Check out adding the [polyfill](/polyfill)
> for details about how you can include it.

## Usage

To use the `<InView>` component , you pass it a function. It will be called
whenever the state changes, with the new value of `inView`. In addition to the
`inView` prop, children also receives a `ref` that should be set on the
containing DOM element. This is the element that the IntersectionObserver will
monitor.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { InView } from 'react-intersection-observer'

const Component = () => (
  <InView>
    {({ inView, ref }) => (
      <div ref={ref}>
        <h2>{`I'm inside viewport: ${inView}.`}</h2>
      </div>
    )}
  </InView>
)

export default Component
```

<LazyAnimation />
